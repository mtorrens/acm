    "First thing to note is that with big amounts of data closed form solution through normal equations is not feasible anymore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing $X^T X$ term takes $O(nk^2)$ operations, while inverse takes $O(k^3)$, where $n$ is number of observations and $k$ is number of variables. Storage is also considerable, $O(k^2)$ for these matrices and $O(nk)$ for matrix $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we deal with these issues? Depends on the type of the problem we have.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Few variables, but many observations**. Storing $X$ can be solved by distributed form of storage, while computing $X^T X$ matrix can be done through a sum of outer products instead of computing inner products. Outer products work great as we can do them separately on each node and then sum them together in the main node. This is feasible if number of dimensions is not that big, in such case matrices of size $k^2$ should be able to fit on a single node.  \n",
    "2. **Many variables, and many observations**. Outer product operation is now also not feasible as matrices of size $k^2$ do not fit in any single node. In these situations we can potentially exploit sparsity to reduce the storage and computational requirements. We can also try to reduce the dimensionality through unsupervised learning techniques, such as SVD or PCA. However, the way out is really to discard the closed form approach and use numerical optimization - (stochastic) gradient descent needs less operations, $O(nk)$, and uses far less storage, $O(k)$.\n",

We will use the Bank marketing dataset from the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) to illustrate these operations. It is not a big dataset but it will serve to illustrate the principles. We could have worked with bigger datasets, but it would have involved a lot of waiting for some of the steps.\n",

We will not implement it, instead, now that you understand much better map-reduce operations that are going on under the hood, go to the next section and use MLlib function for training the logistic regression. That function uses stochastic gradient descent and provides you with several other useful options."
