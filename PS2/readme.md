## Advanced Computational Methods - Problem Set #2

The folder has a folder named `app` and an R script named `app.R`. The code handed in is located inside the `app` folder for submission specification reasons. The script outside this folder contains the original code of the app as it was built. It is the same code unified for the modern type of Shiny apps.

Also, with respect to feedback from previous problem set, I thank you for it. On one of the points, however, I should mention I still name R objects that consist of multiple words separated by a dot (`.`), as this is what the [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) recommends.
