## Advanced Computational Methods - Problem Set #1

# Exercise 1

  * The generated data set is for simplicity limited to either two or three dimensions. This can be relaxed but be aware of the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) when accounting for how many points will fall inside the hypersphere.

  * Bear in mind that the results will be generated in R's working directory: its default directory if not otherwise specified.

# Exercise 2

  * It is unclear to me if this exercise requires to write a function or have only the executable code in the script. Thus, the script contains a function that carries out the exercise and it executes it at the end, to cover all possibilities.

  * The function has a logical argument called `dashed`, which specifies whether the generated plot displays the discriminant functions dashed in the part where the function is not used. If the argument is set to `FALSE` then the plot shows the functions fully colored on its domain. If it is set to `TRUE`, the plot is built in a more manual manner. The code is uglier as it requires to fin the intersection points of the functions and plot them accordingly, but the output is nicer.
